# Water Consumption Prediction using Machine Learning

## Introduction
Water is a critical resource for human survival and development. With the rapid increase in population and urbanization, efficient water management has become a significant challenge. This project applies machine learning methods to predict water consumption and support sustainable practices.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to design an accurate prediction model for household water consumption by analyzing environmental, social, and economic variables. These predictions can be applied to:
- Enhance water distribution strategies,
- Detect unusual consumption patterns,
- Promote sustainability in water use.

## Tools and Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  

## Approach
1. Data preprocessing and cleaning  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Feature engineering  
4. Model training and evaluation  
5. Interpretation of results  

## Results
The trained model produced reliable predictions for water usage, demonstrating the potential of machine learning in resource management.
